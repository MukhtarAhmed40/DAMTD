        \section{Open Science and Artifact Availability}

        Following ACM CCS 2026 Open Science Policy, we provide an anonymized artifact containing representative subsets for the three datasets used in this study: LSNM2024, CIRA-CIC-DoHBrw2020, and CICIoT2023. The full datasets cannot be shared anonymously due to licensing and size; representative subsets (5--10\%) are provided to enable reproducibility and verification of the methodology.

        \noindent\textbf{Anonymous Artifact Links.}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Code and scripts: \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DAMTD-Code-XXXX/}
          \item Dataset subsets: \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DAMTD-Data-ZZZZ/}
        \end{itemize}

        \noindent\textbf{Provided Artifacts.}
        The artifact package includes:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Full implementation of DAMTD (ConvBiLSTM + Multi-head self-attention)
          \item Domain adaptation modules (adversarial + MMD)
          \item Training and evaluation pipelines and configs
          \item Representative subsets for each dataset (anonymized)
          \item Documentation and reproducibility instructions
        \end{itemize}
